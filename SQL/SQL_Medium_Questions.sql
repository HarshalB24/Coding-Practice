SQL Problem:  Income Tax Returns

-- File:        late_or_missed_returns.sql
-- Description: Identify users who either filed their income tax returns late 
--              or completely skipped filing for certain financial years.

-- Definitions:
--   - A return is considered **late** if return_file_date > file_due_date
--   - A return is considered **missed** if there is no return entry for a user 
--     for a given financial year.
-- 
-- Output: List of users with financial year and a comment indicating 
--         'late return' or 'missed'
-- 
-- Sorting: Ascending order of financial year

SQL Problem:    Average Order Value
===============================================

## üìù Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to determine **the transaction date with the lowest average order value (AOV)** among all dates recorded in the `transactions` table.

Display:
- The `transaction_date`
- The corresponding **AOV** (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- The **difference** between the AOV for that date and the **highest AOV** for any day in the dataset (rounded to 2 decimal places)

---

## üìö Table: `transactions`

| COLUMN_NAME         | DATA_TYPE     |
|---------------------|---------------|
| order_id            | int           |

| transaction_date    | date          |
| user_id             | int           |

---

## üéØ Requirements
- Find the **date** with the **lowest AOV**.
- Find the **highest AOV** across all dates.
- Show both the **lowest AOV** and the **difference** between the **lowest AOV** and the **highest AOV**.
- Round all decimal outputs to **2 decimal places**.

SQL Problem: Employee vs Manager Salary and Joining Date Challenge

===============================================

## üìù Problem Statement

You are given a table containing **employee details**.

Write an SQL query to find **details of employees** who:
- Have a **salary greater** than their **manager's salary**, and
- **Joined the company after** their **manager**.

### Output Columns:
- `emp_name`
- `salary`
- `joining_date`
- `manager_salary`
- `manager_joining_date`

Sort the output by **employee name** in ascending order.

> üì¢ **Note**:  
> The `manager_id` in the `employee` table refers to the `emp_id` from the same table (self-reference).

SQL Problem: Cancellation vs Return

===============================================
An order is considered cancelled if it is cancelled before delivery (i.e., cancel_date is not null, and delivery_date is null). If an order is cancelled, no delivery will take place.
An order is considered a return if it is cancelled after it has already been delivered (i.e., cancel_date is not null, and cancel_date > delivery_date).

Metrics to Calculate:
Cancel Rate = (Number of orders cancelled / Number of orders placed but not returned) * 100
Return Rate = (Number of orders returned / Number of orders placed but not cancelled) * 100

Write an SQL query to calculate the cancellation rate and return rate for each month (based on the order_date).Round the rates to 2 decimal places. Sort the output by year and month in increasing order.
 

Table: orders 
+---------------+-----------+
| COLUMN_NAME   | DATA_TYPE |
