SQL Problem: Cancellation vs Return

===============================================
An order is considered cancelled if it is cancelled before delivery (i.e., cancel_date is not null, and delivery_date is null). If an order is cancelled, no delivery will take place.
An order is considered a return if it is cancelled after it has already been delivered (i.e., cancel_date is not null, and cancel_date > delivery_date).

Metrics to Calculate:
Cancel Rate = (Number of orders cancelled / Number of orders placed but not returned) * 100
Return Rate = (Number of orders returned / Number of orders placed but not cancelled) * 100

Write an SQL query to calculate the cancellation rate and return rate for each month (based on the order_date).Round the rates to 2 decimal places. Sort the output by year and month in increasing order.
